            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Workshops</h2>
            Still back when I used to live in Kraków, I had the fortune to provide
            some workshops for people, who were interested on my art. Some gatherings were
            smaller, some with a bit bigger audience, but all of them we enjoyed a
            lot! In this way, I could combine the two things, which - I think at
            least - I am good at: teaching and crocheting.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Travels</h2>
In 2023 I came over one of my fears, namely solo travelling. As I am
            following many crochet and yarn artist all around the world, in
            March a post crossed my path from
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ritacrochetpaintings">
              Rita Cavallaro
            </a>
            where she showed one of her masterpiece and referred to an event,
            where she is going to show it.

            <div class="video-container">
              <iframe
                width="560"
                height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8m833-9QAo?si=P_vThypbKQ76wX26"
                title="YouTube video player"
                frameborder="0"
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
                allowfullscreen
              ></iframe>
            </div>

            30 minutes later I was checking Google Maps, all the cheap flights
            and the event itself, what she was referring to:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yarnbombingbarzano"
              >Yarnbombing Barzano.
            </a>
            Long story short: after seeing all the breahtaking pieces and the
            festival itself, a few hours later all was settled for my journey in
            June to Barzano. Without hesitation and any questionmarks I just
            knew, I have to be there. So I was.
            <p>
              I could not be happier that I fought through my anxiety, not just
              because I've met super cute people, wonderful artists and
              generally was a great adventure - but because there I've met an
              amazing crafty women (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/migliarino.migliarino.9">Migliarino Blue</a
  >)from Vienna! Since then we keep in touch, I can not adore her
              dedication and creativity enough to
               zero waste,
              
              that she
              introduced me to the world of crafty markets and generally, her
              friendship.

              You probably still think, knitting and crocheting is for
              old, sweet ladies. Well, let me show you another event,
              which is still on my bucket list, but one day for sure I would
              like to visit: KNITTING HEAVY METAL CHAMPIONSHIP. Yes, read it one more and yes, it is exactly what it sounds.
              You can read about
